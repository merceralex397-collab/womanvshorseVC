## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The validated finding `EXEC-REMED-001` no longer reproduces.
- [ ] Current quality checks rerun with evidence tied to the fix approach: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

## Artifacts

- plan: .opencode/state/artifacts/history/remed-012/planning/2026-04-17T09-58-22-032Z-plan.md (planning) - Planning artifact for REMED-012: EXEC-REMED-001 is stale — REMED-002's canonical review satisfies the fix contract with all 5 checks PASS. Plan proposes ticket_reconcile with supersede_target:true to supersede REMED-012 as duplicative.
