# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/rowan/womanvshorseVC
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 3
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 1 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

### REMED-029

- linked_report_id: SESSION009
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: When a repo exposes `blender-asset-creator` and the ticket's primary deliverable is a Blender-generated asset, `ticket_lookup.transition_guidance.delegate_to_agent` must route implementation and implementation-recovery paths to `blender-asset-creator` instead of the generic implementer.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-026

- linked_report_id: EXEC-BLENDER-001
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket or repo-owned follow-up
- should_scafforge_repair_run: no further managed repair required before this follow-up
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.

### REMED-027

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket or repo-owned follow-up
- should_scafforge_repair_run: no further managed repair required before this follow-up
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
