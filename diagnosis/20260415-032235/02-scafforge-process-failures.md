# Scafforge Process Failures

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- root_cause: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- safer_target_pattern: Run a deterministic `godot --headless --path . --quit` validation during audit and keep the repo blocked until it succeeds or returns an explicit environment blocker instead.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Godot headless validation fails.

### EXEC-GODOT-005a

- root_cause: The repo has started or closed Android release work but is still missing the repo-managed export preset, android/ support surfaces, or the canonical debug APK. Runnable proof requires export_presets.cfg, non-placeholder android/ surfaces, and a debug APK at the canonical build path.
- safer_target_pattern: Emit export_presets.cfg and android/ surfaces at scaffold time. Block RELEASE-001 closeout until debug APK runnable proof exists at the canonical path.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Android-targeted Godot repo is missing export surfaces or debug APK runnable proof.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### CONFIG012

- root_cause: The generated OpenCode configuration did not stay aligned with the repo's canonical asset route metadata.
- safer_target_pattern: Enable blender_agent only when the inferred asset route requires Blender-MCP and the host exposes the required Blender MCP paths.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: blender_agent is disabled even though the current asset route requires Blender-MCP.

### SKILL001

- root_cause: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left repo-local skills in a placeholder or stale state, so agents lose concrete stack, validation, or asset-workflow guidance.
- safer_target_pattern: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.
