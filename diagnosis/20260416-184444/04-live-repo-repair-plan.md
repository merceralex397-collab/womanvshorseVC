# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/rowan/womanvshorseVC
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 1
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 6 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

- After deterministic repair, rerun project-local skill regeneration, agent-team follow-up, and prompt hardening before handoff.

### REMED-010

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-011

- linked_report_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.

### REMED-012

- linked_report_id: SESSION003
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Reject unsupported stages and dependency overrides up front, tell the coordinator not to probe alternate transitions or close blocked tickets anyway, and return the contract contradiction as a blocker when the required proof is missing.

### REMED-013

- linked_report_id: CONFIG012
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Enable blender_agent only when the inferred asset route requires Blender-MCP and the host exposes the required Blender MCP paths.

### REMED-014

- linked_report_id: SKILL001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.

### REMED-015

- linked_report_id: SKILL002
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: When asset-pipeline metadata requires Blender-MCP, keep `asset-description`, `blender-mcp-workflow`, and a dedicated `blender-asset-creator` in sync with the managed `blender_agent` MCP entry and the repo's asset/audit paths.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-009

- linked_report_id: EXEC-BLENDER-001
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.

- suggested_fix_approach: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
