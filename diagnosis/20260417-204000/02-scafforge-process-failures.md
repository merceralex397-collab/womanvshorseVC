# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-BLENDER-001
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### WFLOW010

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW010
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.

### SKILL001

- linked_report_1_finding: SKILL001
- implicated_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces
- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- workflow_failure: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.

### SKILL003

- linked_report_1_finding: SKILL003
- implicated_surface: project-skill-bootstrap and agent-prompt-engineering surfaces
- ownership_class: project skill or prompt surface
- workflow_failure: The repo requires Blender-MCP for its asset route but is missing mandatory Blender operating surfaces.

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- root_cause: The repo routes assets through blender-agent, but the audit log shows mutating jobs started with null `input_blend` or `output_blend`. Any later conclusion that the Blender bridge itself is broken is untrustworthy until the same step is retried with an explicit saved-blend chain.
- safer_target_pattern: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### WFLOW010

- root_cause: `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` are not being regenerated from `tickets/manifest.json`, `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json`, and `.opencode/meta/pivot-state.json` after workflow mutations or managed repair, leaving bootstrap, repair-follow-on, pivot, verification, lane-lease, or active-ticket state stale.
- safer_target_pattern: Regenerate `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` from canonical manifest, workflow state, and pivot state after every workflow save, compute handoff readiness from bootstrap plus repair-follow-on plus verification state in one shared contract, and fail repair verification if any derived restart surface drifts.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.

### SKILL001

- root_cause: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left repo-local skills in a placeholder or stale state, so agents lose concrete stack, validation, or asset-workflow guidance.
- safer_target_pattern: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.

### SKILL003

- root_cause: The managed repo metadata requires Blender work, but the repo-local agent team and skill pack did not fully materialize the mandatory Blender route contract surfaces.
- safer_target_pattern: When asset-pipeline metadata requires Blender-MCP, keep `asset-description`, `blender-mcp-workflow`, a dedicated `blender-asset-creator`, and the team leader's delegation allowlist in sync with the managed `blender_agent` MCP entry and the repo's asset/audit paths.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The repo requires Blender-MCP for its asset route but is missing mandatory Blender operating surfaces.
