# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-BLENDER-001
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### SESSION003

- linked_report_1_finding: SESSION003
- implicated_surface: scafforge-audit transcript chronology and causal diagnosis surfaces
- ownership_class: audit and lifecycle diagnosis surface
- workflow_failure: The supplied session transcript shows the agent searching for workflow bypasses or soft dependency overrides instead of following the lifecycle contract.

### SESSION006

- linked_report_1_finding: SESSION006
- implicated_surface: scafforge-audit transcript chronology and causal diagnosis surfaces
- ownership_class: audit and lifecycle diagnosis surface
- workflow_failure: The supplied session transcript shows the operator trapped between contradictory workflow rules instead of having one clear legal next move.

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- root_cause: The repo routes assets through blender-agent, but the audit log shows mutating jobs started with null `input_blend` or `output_blend`. Any later conclusion that the Blender bridge itself is broken is untrustworthy until the same step is retried with an explicit saved-blend chain.
- safer_target_pattern: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### SESSION003

- root_cause: Once the lifecycle gate became confusing, the agent started trying unsupported stages, explicit workarounds, or softer 'close it anyway' / dependency-override reasoning instead of resolving the missing proof or contradictory contract.
- safer_target_pattern: Reject unsupported stages and dependency overrides up front, tell the coordinator not to probe alternate transitions or close blocked tickets anyway, and return the contract contradiction as a blocker when the required proof is missing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The supplied session transcript shows the agent searching for workflow bypasses or soft dependency overrides instead of following the lifecycle contract.

### SESSION006

- root_cause: Multiple workflow surfaces failed at once: lifecycle gates, closeout publication, acceptance scope, or deterministic tool execution disagreed about what could legally happen next. The coordinator then had to infer workarounds instead of following one competent contract path.
- safer_target_pattern: Design every workflow state so it exposes one legal next action, one named owner, and one blocker return path. When transcript evidence shows a trap, audit adjacent surfaces together instead of treating each symptom as isolated noise.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The supplied session transcript shows the operator trapped between contradictory workflow rules instead of having one clear legal next move.
