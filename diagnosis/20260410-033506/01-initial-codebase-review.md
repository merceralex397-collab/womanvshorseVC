# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/womanvshorseVC
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-10T03:35:06Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 2
- errors: 2
- warnings: 0

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

No validated workflow, environment, or managed-process findings were detected.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-GODOT-004

- finding_id: EXEC-GODOT-004
- summary: Godot headless validation fails.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: project.godot
- observed_or_reproduced: The project cannot complete a deterministic headless Godot load pass on the current host, indicating broken project configuration or scripts.
- evidence:
  - Error: Can't run project: no main scene defined in the project.
  - Error: Can't run project: no main scene defined in the project.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/artifacts/history/remed-001/review/2026-04-10T00-23-08-781Z-review.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-001 carries finding_source `EXEC-GODOT-004`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/artifacts/history/remed-001/review/2026-04-10T00-23-08-781Z-review.md
  - missing explicit post-fix PASS/FAIL result

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
