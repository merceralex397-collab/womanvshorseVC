## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- root_cause: The repo routes assets through blender-agent, but the audit log shows mutating jobs started with null `input_blend` or `output_blend`. Any later conclusion that the Blender bridge itself is broken is untrustworthy until the same step is retried with an explicit saved-blend chain.
- safer_target_pattern: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### SESSION003

- root_cause: Once the lifecycle gate became confusing, the agent started trying unsupported stages, explicit workarounds, or softer 'close it anyway' / dependency-override reasoning instead of resolving the missing proof or contradictory contract.
- safer_target_pattern: Reject unsupported stages and dependency overrides up front, tell the coordinator not to probe alternate transitions or close blocked tickets anyway, and return the contract contradiction as a blocker when the required proof is missing.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The supplied session transcript shows the agent searching for workflow bypasses or soft dependency overrides instead of following the lifecycle contract.

### SESSION006

- root_cause: Multiple workflow surfaces failed at once: lifecycle gates, closeout publication, acceptance scope, or deterministic tool execution disagreed about what could legally happen next. The coordinator then had to infer workarounds instead of following one competent contract path.
- safer_target_pattern: Design every workflow state so it exposes one legal next action, one named owner, and one blocker return path. When transcript evidence shows a trap, audit adjacent surfaces together instead of treating each symptom as isolated noise.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The supplied session transcript shows the operator trapped between contradictory workflow rules instead of having one clear legal next move.

### SKILL001

- root_cause: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left repo-local skills in a placeholder or stale state, so agents lose concrete stack, validation, or asset-workflow guidance.
- safer_target_pattern: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text or stale synthesized guidance instead of current project-specific procedure.

### SKILL003

- root_cause: The managed repo metadata requires Blender work, but the repo-local agent team and skill pack did not fully materialize the mandatory Blender route contract surfaces.
- safer_target_pattern: When asset-pipeline metadata requires Blender-MCP, keep `asset-description`, `blender-mcp-workflow`, a dedicated `blender-asset-creator`, and the team leader's delegation allowlist in sync with the managed `blender_agent` MCP entry and the repo's asset/audit paths.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The repo requires Blender-MCP for its asset route but is missing mandatory Blender operating surfaces.
