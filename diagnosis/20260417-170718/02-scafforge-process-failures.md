# Scafforge Process Failures

## Scope

- Maps each validated finding back to the Scafforge-owned workflow surface that allowed it through.

## Failure Map

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-BLENDER-001
- implicated_surface: generated repo implementation and validation surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- linked_report_1_finding: EXEC-REMED-001
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory managed template surfaces
- ownership_class: generated repo execution surface
- workflow_failure: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### FINISH002

- linked_report_1_finding: FINISH002
- implicated_surface: scafforge-audit diagnosis contract
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Repo claims ready or finished state, but the finish contract forbids placeholder output and finish-owning tickets are still open.

### WFLOW034

- linked_report_1_finding: WFLOW034
- implicated_surface: repo-scaffold-factory generated workflow, handoff, and tool contract surfaces
- ownership_class: managed workflow contract surface
- workflow_failure: Open-parent remediation follow-up is deadlocked behind a sequential split child that cannot legally activate before the parent closes.

## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-BLENDER-001

- root_cause: The repo routes assets through blender-agent, but the audit log shows mutating jobs started with null `input_blend` or `output_blend`. Any later conclusion that the Blender bridge itself is broken is untrustworthy until the same step is retried with an explicit saved-blend chain.
- safer_target_pattern: Before escalating a Blender-MCP defect, prove one correct chain: `project_initialize(output_blend=...)`, then a mutating follow-up that reuses the returned `persistence.saved_blend` as `input_blend`, and verify `.blender-mcp/audit/*.jsonl` records non-null `input_blend` / `output_blend` on the matching `job_start`.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Recorded Blender-MCP mutating calls violated the stateless saved-blend chaining contract.

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### FINISH002

- root_cause: The restart narrative or workflow state signals completion while the canonical finish contract still requires non-placeholder visuals, audio, or content proof.
- safer_target_pattern: Either close or supersede the open finish tickets with real content proof, or update the restart narrative to stop claiming finished-product ready state until the finish bar is met.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Repo claims ready or finished state, but the finish contract forbids placeholder output and finish-owning tickets are still open.

### WFLOW034

- root_cause: Ticket-pack-builder created an open-parent remediation child as `split_scope + sequential_dependent`, but the source ticket is still open in a blocking review/QA state. The child exists specifically to resolve that blocker, so the parent cannot finish first and the workflow has no legal forward move.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation or source-follow-up tickets that must resolve an open parent's current blocker, create or refresh the child as `split_scope + parallel_independent`, keep `issue_intake` reserved for completed historical tickets, and let ticket_lookup foreground the remediation child while the parent stays open.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Open-parent remediation follow-up is deadlocked behind a sequential split child that cannot legally activate before the parent closes.
