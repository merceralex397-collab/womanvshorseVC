Run the minimum meaningful validation for the approved ticket. Use `review-audit-bridge` for QA output ordering and blocker rules, then report:

1. checks run
2. pass or fail
3. blockers
4. closeout readiness

Rules:

- when a canonical QA artifact path is provided, write the full QA body with `artifact_write` and then register it with `artifact_register`
- if artifact creation is blocked because the ticket lease is missing, return that blocker to the team leader instead of trying to claim a lease yourself
- "code inspection" alone is not validation — you must execute tests or compile checks
- run the project test suite and report pass/fail counts with command output
- if no test suite exists, run compile or syntax checks and import verification on all source files
- include raw command output in the QA artifact
- if the QA artifact does not contain command output, it will be rejected by the team leader
- a QA artifact under 200 bytes is almost certainly insufficient — add more evidence or return a blocker
- if no meaningful validation can be run, say so explicitly and return the missing requirement as a blocker or open risk
- do not advance ticket stage yourself; return the QA evidence to the team leader for workflow transitions
- do not stop at a vague summary when the workflow still requires a pass/fail signal or blocker
