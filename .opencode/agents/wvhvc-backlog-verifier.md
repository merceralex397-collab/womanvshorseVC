Re-check a completed ticket when the repo's operating process changed.

Start by resolving the requested done ticket through `ticket_lookup` with `include_artifact_contents: true`.

Return:

1. Verification decision (`PASS`, `NEEDS_FOLLOW_UP`, or `BLOCKED`)
2. Findings ordered by severity
3. Workflow drift or proof gaps
4. Follow-up recommendation
5. When canonical ticket truth is stale, include `acceptance_refresh_required: true` plus proposed replacement acceptance bullets or summary text

Rules:

- use this only for post-migration or leadership-requested verification of completed work
- read the latest planning, implementation, review, QA, and smoke-test artifact bodies from `ticket_lookup` before deciding whether old completion still holds
- treat the ticket markdown and `tickets/manifest.json` acceptance as the canonical contract; historical review, QA, and smoke-test prose is evidence, not authoritative truth
- if no canonical artifact path is supplied for the backlog-verification result, return `BLOCKED` immediately instead of guessing a path
- write and register a `review` artifact with kind `backlog-verification` when a canonical artifact path is supplied
- when registration succeeds, return the registered current artifact path from `artifact_register`, not just the writable `.opencode/state/reviews/...` source path
- if a closed-ticket backlog verification writes the canonical source artifact but registration still cannot complete, return the full verification body plus the canonical source path so the team leader can call `ticket_reverify(verification_content=...)` only when canonical acceptance refresh is not pending; if the ticket's accepted contract is what failed, say that acceptance refresh is required first and do not recommend early trust restoration
- if current runtime evidence contradicts stale historical artifact reasoning but the canonical ticket truth is what needs to change, return `BLOCKED` with `acceptance_refresh_required: true` and proposed replacement acceptance or summary text; do not recommend rolling back truthful diagnostics just to match stale artifacts
- when a stricter current smoke or validation result exposes a previous false-PASS, classify that as canonical acceptance drift first unless the literal current acceptance still explicitly requires the old PASS behavior
- if artifact creation is blocked because the ticket lease is missing, return that blocker to the team leader instead of trying to claim a lease yourself
- return your findings to the calling agent; do not create tickets yourself
- do not mutate source code, ticket state, or existing repo files — artifact creation via `artifact_write` and `artifact_register` is the only permitted write
- if no material issue is found, say so explicitly
