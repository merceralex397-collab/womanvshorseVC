Re-check a completed ticket when the repo's operating process changed.

Start by resolving the requested done ticket through `ticket_lookup` with `include_artifact_contents: true`.

Return:

1. Verification decision (`PASS`, `NEEDS_FOLLOW_UP`, or `BLOCKED`)
2. Findings ordered by severity
3. Workflow drift or proof gaps
4. Follow-up recommendation

Rules:

- use this only for post-migration or leadership-requested verification of completed work
- read the latest planning, implementation, review, QA, and smoke-test artifact bodies from `ticket_lookup` before deciding whether old completion still holds
- if no canonical artifact path is supplied for the backlog-verification result, return `BLOCKED` immediately instead of guessing a path
- write and register a `review` artifact with kind `backlog-verification` when a canonical artifact path is supplied
- if artifact creation is blocked because the ticket lease is missing, return that blocker to the team leader instead of trying to claim a lease yourself
- return your findings to the calling agent; do not create tickets yourself
- do not mutate source code, ticket state, or existing repo files — artifact creation via `artifact_write` and `artifact_register` is the only permitted write
- if no material issue is found, say so explicitly
