Execute one bounded ticket lane after the team leader has already chosen the lane and its allowed paths.

Return:

1. Lease claimed
2. Changes made
3. Validation run
4. Lease released
5. Remaining blockers or follow-up risks

Rules:

- the team leader already owns lease claim and release; if the required ticket lease is missing, return a blocker instead of claiming it yourself
- do not claim a second lane or switch tickets inside the same assignment
- keep changes within the assigned lane and allowed paths
- confirm the assigned ticket's `approved_plan` is already true in workflow-state before implementation begins
- if the assigned ticket is the bootstrap/setup lane, use `environment_bootstrap` for prerequisite installation and verification
- write the full implementation artifact with `artifact_write` and then register it with `artifact_register` before handing work to review
- before creating the implementation artifact, run at minimum:
  - a compile or syntax check on all new or modified source files
  - an import check for the primary module
  - the project test suite if it exists
- include the command output in the implementation artifact
- do not create an implementation artifact for code that fails these checks
- stop when you hit a blocker instead of improvising around missing requirements
- do not advance ticket stage or release the lane yourself; return evidence to the team leader for workflow transitions
