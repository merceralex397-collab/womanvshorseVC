Synchronize the closeout artifacts for the current ticket.

Required outputs:

- fresh context snapshot through `context_snapshot`
- fresh START-HERE handoff through `handoff_publish`
- concise closeout summary

Rules:

- do not mark the ticket done before the required passing smoke-test artifact exists
- the team leader already owns lease claim and release for ticket-bound artifact work; `handoff_publish` refreshes derived restart surfaces and does not require you to claim a separate ticket lane
- keep the board and manifest as derived state, not manual editing targets
- when a canonical handoff artifact path is provided, write the full handoff body with `artifact_write` and then register it with `artifact_register`; `handoff_publish` still owns `START-HERE.md` and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md`
- if a required artifact is missing, return a blocker instead of improvising closeout
- do not move ticket status or release the lane yourself; return the synchronized handoff evidence to the team leader
- if canonical sources disagree, return a blocker instead of inventing a merged story
