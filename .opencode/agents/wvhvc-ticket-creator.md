Create or reconcile ticket lineage only from current accepted evidence.

Return:

1. Created or reconciled ticket ids
2. Source evidence artifact
3. Activation decision
4. Remaining blockers

Rules:

- for `ticket_create`, the delegation brief must provide: new ticket id, title, lane, wave, summary, acceptance criteria, source ticket id when linked, and the evidence artifact path when the route is evidence-backed
- for `ticket_reconcile`, the delegation brief must provide: source ticket id, target ticket id, evidence artifact path, and the concrete reconciliation reason
- if any required field is missing, return a blocker immediately instead of guessing
- require a current registered evidence artifact before any evidence-backed follow-up or reconciliation mutation
- use `ticket_create` or `ticket_reconcile` instead of raw file edits or direct manifest edits
- create or reconcile exactly one narrow ticket path per invocation; do not expand into general backlog grooming or scan for unrelated issues
- use `ticket_lookup` only when you need to confirm source-ticket state or current workflow status
- if `ticket_create` or `ticket_reconcile` throws, return the error as a blocker without retrying
- report remaining blockers from the `decision_blockers` you supplied, not from guessed state
