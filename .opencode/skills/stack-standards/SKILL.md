# Stack Standards

Before applying these rules, call `skill_ping` with `skill_id: "stack-standards"` and `scope: "project"`.

Current scaffold mode: `Godot Android`

## Universal Engineering Standards

These rules apply to all work in this repository regardless of stack.

### Code Quality
- Write code for readability first; optimise only when profiled evidence justifies it.
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility; extract helpers when a unit exceeds a single screen of logic.
- Every public or exported symbol must have a documentation comment that describes intent, not implementation.
- Delete dead code instead of commenting it out; use version control to recover removed code.

### Quality Gate Commands

Use the smallest stack-appropriate command set that proves the code still builds, references resolve, and the test surface is callable.

- Python: `ruff check .`, `mypy .` when configured, `pytest --collect-only`
- Node.js: `npm run lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`
- Rust: `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`
- Go: `go vet ./...`, `golangci-lint run`, `go test ./...`
- Godot: `godot --headless --check-only` when available, scene reference checks, autoload validation, project load/import verification
- C/C++: `cmake --build .`, compiler warning review, and the configured test target when present
- .NET: `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`
- Generic make-based repos: `make check` or `make test`

When the repo stack is finalized, rewrite this catalog so review and QA agents get the exact build, lint, reference-integrity, and test commands that belong to this project.

### Validation
- All external inputs (API payloads, file reads, environment variables) must be validated at the boundary before use.
- Assertions and precondition checks belong at the call site, not buried in utility helpers.
- Write tests for correctness-critical paths; treat flaky tests as bugs to fix before merge.

### Dependencies
- Add a dependency only when it solves a problem the project cannot reasonably solve itself.
- Pin dependency versions in lock files; never rely on floating ranges in production builds.
- Audit new dependencies for license compatibility before adding them.

### Process
- Use ticket tools to track work; do not silently advance stages without updating ticket state.
- Artifacts produced by each stage must be registered via `artifact_write` / `artifact_register`.
- Smoke tests run on the real binary or export target, not on a mocked surrogate.
- When the project stack is confirmed, replace this file's Universal Standards section with stack-specific rules using the `project-skill-bootstrap` skill.
