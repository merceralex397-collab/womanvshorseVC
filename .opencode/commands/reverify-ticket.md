description: Restore trust on a historical ticket using linked remediation evidence

Resolve the historical ticket, confirm the linked remediation evidence, and use the reverification flow to restore trust only when the evidence closes the original defect or proves a reopened historical ticket no longer reproduces.

Rules:

- Treat this slash command as a human entrypoint only.
- Use `ticket_reverify` rather than editing trust fields manually.
- Do not use `ticket_reverify` while canonical acceptance refresh is pending; refresh or re-affirm the ticket's acceptance with `ticket_update(acceptance=[...])` first.
- Require current evidence from the same ticket or a linked follow-up ticket before restoring trust.
- Link any remediation evidence back to the historical ticket before claiming the defect is closed.
